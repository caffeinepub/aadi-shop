  "summary": "The diff implements most requirements for the e-commerce website. All major features are present: homepage with product display, product catalog with filtering, product details, shopping cart, checkout flow, order management, and admin interface with Internet Identity authentication. The design uses a modern UI component library with earth-toned styling. However, some required images are missing, and there is no evidence that price range filtering is fully implemented on the frontend UI.",

      "reason": "ProductFilters.tsx has a price range slider component and passes priceRange state, but there's no evidence in ProductsPage.tsx (truncated/omitted) showing actual filtering logic that applies the price range to filter the displayed products",
